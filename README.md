The CSS `@supports` rule specifies a support condition for feature support on a browser, 
i.e. a specific CSS style property can be specified as a condition **to check for its support on the browser** 
and if the condition is true then the block of code is executed else not. It is a **CSS conditional rule** and comes under CSS at-rule. 

Syntax:

```css
  @supports (condition) {
      //  Style you want to apply
  }
```
